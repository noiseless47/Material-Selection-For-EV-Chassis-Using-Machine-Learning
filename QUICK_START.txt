===================================
QUICK START GUIDE - EV CHASSIS MATERIAL SELECTION
===================================

1. REQUIREMENTS:
   - Python 3.6 or higher
   - Required packages:
     numpy, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn, seaborn, xgboost, graphviz

2. INSTALLATION:
   Run this command to install all required packages:
   
   pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn seaborn xgboost graphviz

3. RUNNING THE SCRIPT:
   Ensure 'material.csv' is in the same directory as the script, then run:
   
   python ev_chassis_material_selection.py

4. UNDERSTANDING THE RESULTS:
   - The script will display the accuracy of different models
   - Visual outputs will be saved to the current directory
   - The script will conclude with an example material prediction
   - Decision Tree and Random Forest models typically give the highest accuracy

5. FILES DESCRIPTION:
   - ev_chassis_material_selection.py: Main Python script
   - material.csv: Dataset with material properties
   - model_comparison.png: Generated image comparing model performance
   - decision_tree.png: Visualization of decision tree model
   - confusion_matrix_*.png: Confusion matrices for different models

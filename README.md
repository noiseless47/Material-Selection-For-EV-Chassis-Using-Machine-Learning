# 🚗🔍 Material Selection for EV Chassis using Machine Learning

I’m excited to share a key milestone in my machine learning journey! This project focused on leveraging machine learning to tackle the critical problem of material selection for electric vehicle (EV) chassis.

📚 Research Highlights:

In this study, I utilized a dataset from the Autodesk Material Library, containing mechanical properties of various materials, to build predictive models for material selection. The dataset originally had 15 features, but after handling missing values, I narrowed it down to seven key attributes.

🔍 Machine Learning Process:

Using scikit-learn and other Python libraries like NumPy and pandas, I implemented several models to predict the optimal materials for EV chassis. The models and their performance were:

•	Linear Regression: 88.7%

•	Support Vector Machine: 91.6%

•	K-Neighbors Classifier: 98.7%

•	Decision Tree: 99.7%

•	Random Forest Classifier: 99.7%

•	XGBoost: 99.4%

The standout performers were Decision Tree and Random Forest Classifier, showcasing exceptional accuracy and reliability for this application.

🤖 Key Takeaways:

•	Data preprocessing is crucial for ensuring the quality and relevance of input features.

•	Machine learning models can significantly streamline and enhance decision-making processes in material selection.

•	Exploring diverse algorithms provides deeper insights and helps identify the best-fit model for a given problem.

🌟 This project strengthened my understanding of machine learning for real-world applications, particularly in the field of material science and engineering. If you're interested in the technical details or want to explore the dataset, check out my GitHub repository.
